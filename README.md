### Optimization Profiles

XreatOptimizer features 5 intelligent optimization profiles that automatically switch based on server conditions:

| Profile | TPS Range | Description | Resource Usage |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **LIGHT** | > 19.5 TPS | Minimal optimizations, maximum gameplay features | Low impact |
| **NORMAL** | 18-19.5 TPS | Balanced optimization for most servers | Moderate |
| **AGGRESSIVE** | 16-18 TPS | Maximum optimizations without gameplay impact | High impact |
| **EMERGENCY** | < 16 TPS | Extreme measures to stabilize server | Very high |
| **AUTO** | Any | AI decides best profile automatically | Adaptive |

### Cross-Version Compatibility

XreatOptimizer uses advanced reflection and version adapters to support all Minecraft versions:

## Optimization Profiles

### Profile Selection Logic

The AUTO profile (default) intelligently switches between optimization levels based on:

1. **TPS (Ticks Per Second)**: Primary factor for profile selection
2. **Memory Usage**: Increases optimization when memory >80%
3. **Entity Count**: Adjusts entity limits based on current load
4. **Historical Performance**: AI learns patterns and adjusts thresholds

### Profile Details

#### LIGHT Profile
- **Activation**: TPS > 19.5
- **Features**:
  - Basic entity cleanup
  - Minimal chunk hibernation
  - Standard memory management
- **Best For**: High-performance servers with strong hardware

#### NORMAL Profile
- **Activation**: TPS between 18.0 and 19.5
- **Features**:
  - Regular entity optimization
  - Standard hibernation
  - Moderate memory cleanup
- **Best For**: Most servers under normal load

#### AGGRESSIVE Profile
- **Activation**: TPS between 16.0 and 18.0
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced entity cleanup
  - Aggressive chunk hibernation
  - Dynamic view distance reduction
  - Enhanced memory management
- **Best For**: Servers under high load or with many plugins

#### EMERGENCY Profile
- **Activation**: TPS < 16.0
- **Features**:
  - Maximum entity removal
  - Extreme chunk unloading
  - View distance minimization
  - Simulation distance reduction
  - Forced garbage collection
- **Best For**: Crisis situations and server recovery

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Will this plugin conflict with other optimization plugins?**
A: XreatOptimizer is designed as an all-in-one solution and may conflict with similar plugins like ClearLag, Hibernate, or Chunky. It's recommended to use XreatOptimizer alone for best results.

**Q: Does this work on modded servers?**
A: XreatOptimizer is designed for vanilla and Bukkit-based servers. Modded servers (Forge, Fabric) are not officially supported.

**Q: Will this affect gameplay or remove player items?**
A: No. The plugin only removes dropped items after 10 minutes (with warnings), and never touches player inventories, chests, or other containers.

**Q: Can I disable the branding messages?**
A: No. Branding messages are hardcoded and cannot be disabled or modified.

### Performance Questions

**Q: How much RAM will this save?**
A: Typically 50-90% depending on configuration. Empty servers see the most dramatic savings (up to 90%).

**Q: Does this work on servers with many plugins?**
A: Yes! XreatOptimizer is designed to work alongside other plugins and can help mitigate performance issues caused by plugin overload.

**Q: Will this fix my lag issues?**
A: XreatOptimizer addresses most common lag causes (entities, chunks, memory) but cannot fix issues caused by extremely heavy plugins or inadequate hardware.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Does this modify world files?**
A: No. XreatOptimizer only optimizes runtime behavior and does not modify world save files.

**Q: Is this compatible with backup plugins?**
A: Yes, fully compatible with all backup plugins.

**Q: Can I use this with world management plugins (Multiverse, etc.)?**
A: Yes, XreatOptimizer is compatible with all major world management plugins.
